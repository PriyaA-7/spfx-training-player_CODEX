## TrainingCompletionRegister list schema

Each item represents one user completing one training module. The schema is designed for audit evidence (SOC/ISO) by keeping immutable identifiers, timestamps, and controlled status fields while avoiding unnecessary personal data.

- Store dates in UTC and use consistent formatting.
- Restrict edits on completed records; prefer append-only or versioning for audit trails.
- Limit access to the list and enable item-level permissions and version history.
